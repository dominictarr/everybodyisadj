Bond... I made this video a time ago and I just felt like uploading it now after my first video (did better than I'd expect actually). I just took stills from the movies at the first time of every movie when you get to see Bond. Yes. I know. Kinda odd. Yeah well, music by Duran Duran-A View To A Kill. And I think there's two more Bond videos coming here; One with the villains and another one with the history of Bond. I'll make and upload them whenever the hell I want to, but I AM THAT FUCKING LAZY, so it will take a LONG time... PS Sorry for the bad quality, made this on my lap-top LYRICS: Meeting you with a view to a kill face to face in secret places feel the chill Nightfall covers me but you know the plans I'm making Still over sea could it be the whole world opening wide A sacred why a mystery gaping inside the weekends why until we Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need Dance into the fire that fatal sound is all we need Dance in to the fire that fatal kiss is all we need dance into the fire Choice for you is the view to a kill between the shades assassination standing still First crystal tears fall of snowflakes on your body First time in years to drench your skin with lovers rosy stain A chance to find a phoenix for the flame a chance to die but can we Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need Dance into the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams Dance into the fire that fatal kiss <b>...</b>","rating":4.8591547,"_sort":"yTCc","type":"track"},1337951847699,"#10"]
