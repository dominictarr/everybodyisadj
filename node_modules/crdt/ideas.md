idea of relational db feeling more and more right.

 - suits way that statebased kv crdts work.
 - schema-less rows... (optional schema, i mean)
 - concurrent changes, eventual consistency.

   IDEA: eventually consistent transaction?
   have opperations that either apply or not,
   but without using transactions. 

benefits

track every object by id.
  - easy to manage updates.
  - track histroy in one place.

assemble sets, sequences, from groups that have a particular key.
example type: 'user', but could also point to an object...

sets do not need any persistent state...

so, should be able to seperate histroy, from current state, enable changing memberships of sets
(that means you could easily build trello).

am I convinced yet?
