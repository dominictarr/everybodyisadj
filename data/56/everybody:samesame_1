(I totally love it) Lyrics: Of all the money that e'er I had I've spent it in good company And all the harm that I've ever done Alas it was to none but me And all I've done for want of wit To memory now I can't recall So fill to me the parting glass Good night and joy be to you all So fill to me the parting glass And drink a health whate'er befalls I'll gently rise and softly call Good night and joy be to you all If I had money enough to spend And leisure time to stay awhile There is a fair maid in the town That sorely has my heart beguiled Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips I own she has my heart enthralled So fill to me the parting glass Good night and joy be to you all So fill to me the parting glass And drink a health whate'er befalls I'll gently rise and softly call Good night and joy be to you all Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had They're sorry for my going away And all the sweethearts that e'er I had They'd wish me one more day to stay But since it falls unto my lot That I shall rise and you should not I'll gently rise and softly call Good night and joy be to you all So fill to me the parting glass And drink a health whate'er befalls I'll gently rise and softly call Good night and joy be to you all I'll gently rise and softly call Good night and joy be to you all Good night and joy be to you all (Disclaimer: I own no rights to neither the music nor the picture)","rating":5,"_sort":"VuQq","type":"track"},1337957789730,"#551"]

Can I doubt His tender mercy, Who through life has been my guide? Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, Here by faith in Him to dwell; For I know whate'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well; For I know whate'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well. All the way my Savior leads me; O the fullness of His love! Perfect rest to me is promised In my Father's house above; When I wake to life immortal, Wing my flight to realms of day, This my song through endless ages, Jesus lead me all the way; This my song through endless ages, Jesus lead me all the way, Jesus lead me all the way.","rating":4.908257,"_sort":"k_U8","type":"track"},1337957794890,"#551"]
