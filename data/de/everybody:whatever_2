Make my intro, little duction, And that's when I decided to stick around and bump it. I was schemin', I was ooh, Thinkin' how I could ditch my crew too, Meet ya outside, jump in my ride, For a piece of paradise. [Chorus:] How about a little bit of wha, wha, what? What do you say you give me some of the unh huh? Baby if you're feelin' me make a move, Cos' I just wanna get wit you. How about a little bit of ooh, ooh, ooh. What do you say you give me some of that (WOOH), Baby if you're feelin' me holler boo, Cos' I just wanna wha, wha, what with you... I was chillin', with the fellas, Keepin' it cool cause I knew they were jealous. So I freestyled, yeah I was flowin', Sayin' all the little things I thought would get you going. Well I heard that, you better step back, If you're not prepared to put you money where your mouth's at, What you saying' cos' I ain't playin', I don't got all night, and time's wastin'. [Chorus: (x2)] [Rap by: Phantom] The way you're lookin sweetheart has got me hot and heated, I can really see it that you really need it, So if you're thinkin' what I'm think' then shorty let's go, Backseat of my ride, we can sing an episode. So ma, Ditch your friends, I'll ditch my mens <b>...</b>","rating":4.8,"_sort":"k4yC","type":"track"},1338209179734,"#471"]
